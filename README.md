# Multilingual_Conversational_Model
This project demonstrates a multilingual conversational model using various components including Google Dialogflow and Google Cloud Translation API. The conversational model is designed to answer specific questions related to an airline company's ticket cancellation and luggage policy in multiple languages.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to prototype and evaluate the feasibility of implementing a multilingual conversational model for the airline company. The conversational model should be able to handle conversations in different languages, provide accurate responses, and integrate with a user-friendly front-end interface.

## Conclusion
The multilingual conversational model prototype demonstrates the integration of various components to enable language understanding, translation, and response generation. Further iterations and improvements can be made to create a more robust and accurate conversational model.
